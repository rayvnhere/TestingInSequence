What we did in class 2
__________________________________________________________________________________________
1) created utilsPackage under java and (created javaClass of CommonMethods)
2) (used inheritance) by extending CommonMethod in step's classes
3) created runnersPackage and created a javaCLass of RunnerClass
to execute from one place
We need to control the flow of execution
to execute all the test cases of featuresFile (can be considered regression cuz its tests everything)
to execute some of the test cases from featuresFile
to execute one of the test cases from featuresFile

4) @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
features path
glue
dryRun (true    false)
tag

NOTES by Sr. MS

utils  package is for all the utility classes

we need junit to work with cucumber
cucumber options-
features - the path of features directory to execute all the TC's in one go
glue - the path of the steps package, runner class will find all the step defs here
dry run - if we set it to true, it will stop actual execution and scans all the steps
if any step is missing, it will give me step definition for that step
if we set it to false, then again execution will st6art
tags - when we need to execute specific group of test cases or any specific TC
we use tags.
There is no limitation of using tags in scenarios
